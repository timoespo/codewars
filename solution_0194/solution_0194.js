// Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

// Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

// Here's, an example:

// f(n=100) // returns 5050

function f(n) {
  return parseInt(n) === n && n > 0 ? (n * (n + 1)) / 2 : false
}

console.log(f(100), 5050)
console.log(f('n'), false)
console.log(f(0), false)
console.log(f(3.14), false)
console.log(f(300), 45150)

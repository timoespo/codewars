    <p>You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.
        Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.
        For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.</p>

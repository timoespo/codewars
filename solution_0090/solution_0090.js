// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

function friend(friends) {
  return friends.filter((word) => word.length === 4)
}

console.log(friend(['Ryan', 'Kieran', 'Mark']), ['Ryan', 'Mark'])
console.log(friend(['Ryan', 'Jimmy', '123', '4', 'Cool Man']), ['Ryan'])

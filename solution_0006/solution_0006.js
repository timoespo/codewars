//Grasshopper Summation - Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

let summation = function(num) {
    sum = 0
    for (let i = 0 ; i <= num ; i++) {
        sum += i
    } return sum
}

//test cases 
summation(8) //36
summation(400) //80200

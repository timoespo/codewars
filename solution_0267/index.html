      Codewars Solution 0267 - Find the missing term in an Arithmetic
      Progression

    <p>
      An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one in which there is a constant
      difference between the consecutive terms of a given series of numbers. You
      are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There
      is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing
      from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the
      given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing term. You
      have to write a function that receives a list, list size will always be at
      least 3 numbers. The missing term will never be the first or last one.

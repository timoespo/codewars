    <title>Codewars Solution 0091 - Categorize New Members</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior
      and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will
      tell prospective members which category they will be placed. To be a
      senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater
      than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better
      the player the lower the handicap. Input Input will consist of a list of
      pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member.
      Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for
      the person's handicap. Output Output will consist of a list of string
      values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective
      member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

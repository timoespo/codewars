// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

// years divisible by 4 are leap years
// but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
// but years divisible by 400 are leap years
// Additional Notes:

// Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them

function isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0) || year % 400 === 0
}

console.log(isLeapYear(1234), false)
console.log(isLeapYear(1984), true)
console.log(isLeapYear(2000), true)
